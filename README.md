Econ 491 Applied Machine Learning @University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 2023-2024

The course features 4 Assignments/Projects throughout the semester with a midterm/final exam as well as a final project. The projects are half written math/theory and half applied analysis of real world datasets. This repo included all assets from the course (which felt more like a semester of research than a class) and documents my progression in MLOps.
